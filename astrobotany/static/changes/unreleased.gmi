# TODO: Fill in release data

## Changes

* Introducing badge series two! 100 new emoji badges to collect & trade.
* Fixed dead plants possibly showing up when filtering by "flowering".
* Visiting a plant will now display a message if it's owner has not watered it for over 5 days. The data necessary for this was not previously collected, so the clock will reset to 0 for all plants starting now.
